# About Me

My name is Tomoko Tchuke, and I am a Keeper of the Moon born in the South Shroud. While I was raised in accordance with the traditions of my clan, I developed an early fascination with the nature of aetherâ€”particularly its relationship to memory and emotion. What began as an intuitive sensitivity evolved into a focused academic pursuit.

Though not formally enrolled in the Studium, I undertook private study under **Archon Elsenne Valahyre**, a former member of the Circle of Aetherial Theory. Following her departure from institutional academia, she continued her research independently and accepted me as an apprentice. Under her mentorship, I was introduced to Sharlayan methodologies of observation, hypothesis formulation, and documentation, with a particular emphasis on cognitive aetherology.

My current research investigates the fundamental properties of aether at the particle level. This includes field observation, qualitative analysis of aetherial anomalies, and comparative studies involving recorded soul phenomena. While I do not practice conventional spellcraft, my work is concerned with the underlying principles that connect perception, experience, and aetheric resonance. My overarching goal is to articulate a foundational framework of axioms to describe, classify, and predict aetherial behavior.

Presently, I conduct independent research throughout Eorzea, maintaining correspondence with contacts in Sharlayan and the Noumenon. Although I do not hold a formal position within the Studium, my findings have been cited in minor aetherial journals and research compendia, with recent publications granting me access into the Sharlayan libraries.
