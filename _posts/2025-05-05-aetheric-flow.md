title: "Lunar Influence on Aetheric Flow: Observations from Eastern La Noscea"
---

## Abstract
Aetheric flows in Eastern La Noscea display minor but persistent oscillations during the lunar cycle’s waning phase. These fluctuations appear especially pronounced in regions once shaped by Allagan presence.

## Observations
- Aetheric density increased slightly (2.3% avg.) during the 4th to 6th nights.
- Nearby fauna showed behavioral agitation corresponding with peak shifts.

## Interpretations
The moon’s pull—so often spiritualized among my kin—may have a measurable effect upon certain leyline junctions, particularly in zones where Allagan relics lie dormant.

## Reflections
Would those long-lost engineers have anticipated such resonance? Or did they, perhaps, intend it?
